# American Sign Language Recognition using Arduino
This project aims at helping deaf and dumb overcome their limitations by using a glove which has a lot of sensors incoporated in it. The glove sends data to Arduino and the Arduino processes the data and sens text messages to particular persons.

## Hardware Used

1. Arduino UNO R3
2. Flex Sensors (three in this case)
3. Accelerometer Sensor
